### Author: Maurik Holtrop

These modules are used in the Physics 605 lab at the 
University of New Hampshire.

The current version is compatible with python3 and no longer with python2.
On the latest version of Raspbian (bookworm), python2 is no longer supported for GPIO.

## Modules:

1. MCP320x - Module for reading the MCP3208 (and related MCP3202/4) 12-bit ADCs using the GPIO pins.
1. MCP320xspi - Module for reading the MCP3208 (and related MCP3202/4) 12-bit ADCs using the SPI pins.
1. MAX7219 - Module for driving the MAX7219 based displays.
1. BME280 - Module for reading the BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor.
1. SN74HC165 - Module for reading the SN74HC165 8-bit parallel-in/serial-out shift register.
1. SN74HC595 - Module for driving the SN74HC595 8-bit serial-in/parallel-out shift register.
