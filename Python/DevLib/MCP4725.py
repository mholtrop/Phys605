# This driver sets the output on a MCP4725 chip, and also reads back the current setting.
#
# To see if the MCP4725 is available on the bus execute:
#  sudo i2cdetect -y 1
# You should see a grid with all the I2C devices. This device shows up as
# "62" normalle.
#
# Addresses for this device:
# The factory sets the first 4 address bits to 1100, the next three bits are A2,A1,A0
# The A2,A1 bit are determined by the chip model. The normal setting is 01.
# A0 is determined by a pin on the chip, and is set to 0, resulting in address = 0x62
# A jumper on the board allow you to change this from GND (A0=0) to VCC (A0=1).
# If you switch the jumper the normal address will be 0x63
#
# I2C Bus access for Python, see: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/smbus2

# Based on the datasheet at: https://www.microchip.com/datasheet/MCP4725

# Looked that the AdaFruit code: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP4725.git
#
# Details of operation:
#
# The chip does NOT use an "address" for the register you write to, however the smbus library
# always expects that you are writing an address, since normal I2C data is:
#  <chip address><R/W bit> | <register address>  | <byte 0> | <byte 1> | ...
# For this chip, we thus need to send the first byte of data as the register address,
# and the second byte of data as byte0, etc.
# Verified with the Analog Discovery that this is correct.
