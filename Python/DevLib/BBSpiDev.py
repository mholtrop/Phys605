# BBSpiDev = Bit Bang SPI device.
#
# This is a software, pure Python, based SPI interface that uses regular GPIO lines.
# It is a heavily modified version of the Adafruit_GPIO/SPI.py example. The reasons
# for modifying are plenty, but mainly to make this Python class a drop-in replacement
# for the _standard_ spidev implementation, rather than needing to go fully the Adafruit way
# of dealing with SPI.
