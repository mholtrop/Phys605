    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A really nice feature of Python is the Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks run in your browser. They use a *Markdown*, (see this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for help) with HTML and LaTex mixed in, to nicely format the text comments, and they use full Python to do computations. There are plugins to do C++ or Julia as well, if you insist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is itself a Jupyter notebook. You can look at it on GitHub, which renders a static picture for you, but if you download it and launch it on your own system, you can make modifications, save the result, and run the Python code directly in the notebook. It is possible, and sometimes is even works, to run the notebook on someone else's server. You can pass the GitHub URL to [Binder](mybinder.org) and have a fully interactive notebook (without the save option). Binder is still a bit experimental, but getting better. All the Phys605 notebooks are already available there:[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mholtrop/phys605)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigate** to Python/Getting_Started and you will find this notebook there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Binder notebooks (and thus this link) are *static*. Even if the files on GitHub are updated, the notebook on Binder will not. You need to create a new Binder by feeding the GitHub base URL (https://github.com/mholtrop/Phys605) into the box and re-building. If none of this works, don't worry and run the code on your own computer instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of notebook in Physics 605, and for some homework and lab reports. It is a very convenient way for your to submit your work. You can submit the notebook (.ipynb extension) or submit a GitHub URL pointing to your own repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily convert the notebooks to pure Python scripts, or HTML webpage, or Latex pages. You can print the result to paper or to pdf. A Jupyter notebook can also be exported to pdf directly if you install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and LaTex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To get started wiht Jupyter Notebooks, you first need to have installed ipython and the jupyter libraries. Fortunately this is already done for you if you installed the Anaconda Python distribution. See [Installing Python]( https://unh.instructure.com/courses/24545/pages/installing-python-on-your-own-system) on MyCources for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to get the notebook server started on you own machine:\n",
    "* You can use the \"Anaconda-Navigator\" and click on \"Launch\" for the Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "* You can type \"jupyter notebook\", or \"jupyter-notebook\", in a terminal, Powershell, or command window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you want to start Jupyter from the directory where all your code resides, so that the \"home\" window shows your code or the directories where your code is. See: [Jupyter Documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter server will start up on your system, and usually, starts your browser on a page http://localhost:8888 "

    "## Entering and running code\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter notebook you type text into the input box, and if you are done, you type shift+enter to execute that code. The same is true for the Markdown text, type shift+enter and the text is rendered pretty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a notebook with a bunch of Python code in it, you usually need to execute the in[] lines in order, since what was computed before may be needed later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the notebook document in your browser, you see a standard menu bar. Note the black square for \"interrupt kernel\". That is what you hit if you had some code that takes too long to complete and is now hogging your computer's CPU. The circular arrow allows you to re-launch the kernel, which is a full reset. That means that the in[] fields need to be executed again from the 1st one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You switch the *type* of input, between code, Markdown, Raw, with the selector box next to the arrow. The Markdown input does not a an in[] in front, and usually does not need to be executed again.\n",
