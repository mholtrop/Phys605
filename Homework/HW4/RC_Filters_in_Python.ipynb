    "## Numerically calculating the response of an RC filter network\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to compute the resonse of a circuit that contains resistors, capacitors, and inductors. You can do the analysis with complex impedances and then analyze the circuit response with a Fast Fourier Transform (this notebook), or you can solve the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) directly, see [Solving_RC_low_pass_with_ODE](https://github.com/mholtrop/Phys605/blob/master/Python/Signal/Solving_RC_low_pass_with_ODE.ipynb) \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first method, we use the impedance definition for a capacitor (or an inductor) to work out the response of an RC (or RL or RLC) network. The initial math is similar to the resistor networks, but now instead of R we have Z, and complicating things a little, Z is complex. The frequency response, in a Bode plot, can be worked out using the FFT tools of Python's SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the simplest low pass filter is a resistor and a capacitor to ground. Like this:\n",
    "<img src=\"rc_filter_circuit.pdf\" alt=\"Low Pass RC Filter\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "For the analysis of this circuit, we first need to remember that for a resistor $Z_R = R$, and for a capacitor $Z_C = \\frac{-j}{\\omega C}$. The circuit forms just a voltage divider, but now with a capacitor replacing the second resistor. If the input to our circuit is a pure sinusoidal signal, then we can compute the output voltage as:\n",
    "$$ V_{out}(t) = V_{in}(t) \\left(\\frac{Z_C}{Z_R + Z_C} \\right)= V_{in}(t)\\left(\\frac{-j/\\omega C}{R- j/\\omega C} \\right) = V_{in}(t)\\left(\\frac{1}{jR\\omega C +1} \\right)  $$\n",
    "We could simplify this statement, or just enter it as a Python formula as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we need to first learn about complex numbers in Python. Actually, they are really easy, if we use Numpy (or Scipy). The complex number is just $\\sqrt{-1} = 1j$. You enter a complex number as: `1j` or `0.123+0.4j`.\n",
